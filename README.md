## ✨ Overview

This project was developed for **Project 6: GCP**.  
The goal is to create an interactive college inquiry chatbot that:

- collects a student's **first name**, **last name**, and **email address**
- provides **4 predefined student inquiry questions**
- returns **detailed answers** for each question
- shows a **final summary page**
- is deployable on **Google Cloud Platform**

In addition to the required rubric-based chatbot flow, this project includes a **bonus AI assistant mode** powered by **Gemini**, which can answer free-text questions within a controlled college-information scope.

  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email Address

## 🤖 Bonus AI Assistant

This project also includes an optional **Gemini integration** inside a separate `bonus_ai/` module.

## 💡 Predefined Student Questions

The chatbot supports the following required questions:

1. **Does the college have a football team?**
2. **Does it offer a Computer Science major?**
3. **What is the in-state tuition?**
4. **Does it provide on-campus housing?**

These questions are mapped to detailed fixed responses in the application.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gcp-chatbot
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

> The Gemini key is only needed if you want to use the **bonus AI assistant mode**.

---

## ▶️ Run Locally

Start the FastAPI application with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then open:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## ☁️ Deploy to Google App Engine

This project is configured for **Google App Engine** using `app.yaml`.

### Deploy command

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

### Example `app.yaml`

```yaml
runtime: python311
entrypoint: gunicorn -w 2 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app
```

After deployment, your app will be available through a public GCP URL that can be submitted for grading.

## 🧠 How Gemini Bonus Mode Works

The bonus AI assistant is implemented inside the `bonus_ai/` folder and is kept separate from the core required chatbot logic.

### It includes:

* `college_facts.py` — configured facts used to ground responses
* `prompts.py` — assistant instructions and fallback messages
* `gemini_client.py` — Gemini request handling
* `schemas.py` — basic typed data structures

### Guardrail behavior

If a question falls outside the configured college facts, the assistant returns a safe fallback response instead of inventing unsupported details.

---

## 📋 Example College Facts Used in Bonus Mode

* The college has an intercollegiate football team.
* The college offers a Computer Science major.
* In-state tuition is approximately **$11,500** per academic year.
* The college provides on-campus housing options.
